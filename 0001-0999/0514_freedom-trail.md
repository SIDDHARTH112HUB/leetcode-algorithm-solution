[514.freedom-trail](https://leetcode.com/problems/freedom-trail/)  

In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial called the "Freedom Trail Ring", and use the dial to spell a specific keyword in order to open the door.

Given a string **ring**, which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string **key**, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the **minimum** number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the **ring** is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string **key** one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string **key** aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character **key\[i\]**:

1.  You can rotate the **ring** clockwise or anticlockwise **one place**, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string **ring's** characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character **key\[i\]**.
2.  If the character **key\[i\]** has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.

**Example:**

Â 

  
**Input:** ring = "godding", key = "gd"
  
**Output:** 4
  
**Explanation:**
  
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
  
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".
  
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
  
So the final output is 4.
  

**Note:**

1.  Length of both ring and **key** will be in range 1 to 100.
2.  There are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.
3.  It's guaranteed that string **key** could always be spelled by rotating the string **ring**.  



**Solution:**  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int> > dp;
    int findRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {
        return dfs(ring, key, 0, 0);
    }
    
    int dfs(string &ring, string &key, int i, int j) {
        if(j == key.size())
            return 0;
        if (dp[i].count(j))
            return dp[i][j];
        int res = INT_MAX;
        for(int k = 0; k < ring.size(); ++k) {
            if(ring[k] == key[j]) {
                int diff = min(abs(i - k), min((int)ring.size() - k + i, (int)ring.size() - i + k)) + 1;
                res = min(res, dfs(ring, key, k, j+1) + diff);
            }
        }
        dp[i][j] = res;
        return res;
    }
};
```
