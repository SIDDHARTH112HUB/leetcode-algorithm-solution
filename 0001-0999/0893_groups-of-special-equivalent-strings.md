[893.groups-of-special-equivalent-strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/)  

You are given an array `A` of strings.

A _move onto `S`_ consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of `S`, or any two odd indexed characters of `S`.

Two strings `S` and `T` are _special-equivalent_ if after any number of _moves onto `S`_, `S == T`.

For example, `S = "zzxy"` and `T = "xyzz"` are special-equivalent because we may make the moves `"zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz"` that swap `S[0]` and `S[2]`, then `S[1]` and `S[3]`.

Now, a _group of special-equivalent strings from `A`_ is a non-empty subset of A such that:

1.  Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
2.  The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string S not in the group such that S is special equivalent to every string in the group)

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `A`.

**Example 1:**

  
**Input:** \["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"\]
  
**Output:** 3
  
**Explanation:** 
  
One group is \["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"\], since they are all pairwise special equivalent, and none of the other strings are all pairwise special equivalent to these.
  

  
The other two groups are \["xyzz", "zzxy"\] and \["zzyx"\].  Note that in particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".
  

**Example 2:**

  
**Input:** \["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"\]
  
**Output:** 3

**Note:**

*   `1 <= A.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`
*   All `A[i]` have the same length.
*   All `A[i]` consist of only lowercase letters.  



**Solution:**  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSpecialEquivGroups(vector<string>& A) {
        int ans = 0;
        map<string, int> m;
        for(auto &s:A){
            string s1, s2;
            for( int i = 0; i<s.size(); i++){
                char c = s[i];
                if( i % 2 == 0 ){
                    s1 += c;
                }else{
                    s2 += c;
                }
            }
            sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
            sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());
            m[s1+s2]++;
        }
        return m.size();
    }
};
```
