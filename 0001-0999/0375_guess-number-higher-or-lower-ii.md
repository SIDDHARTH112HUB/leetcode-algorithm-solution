We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay **$x**. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

**Example:**

  
n = 10, I pick 8.
  

  
First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
  
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
  
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
  

  
Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
  

  
You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
  

Given a particular **n â‰¥ 1**, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a **win**.  



**Solution:**  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int> > dp(n+1, vector<int>(n+1));
        return solve(1, n, dp);
    }
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    int solve(int l, int r, vector<vector<int> > &dp){
        if( l >= r ) return 0;
        if(dp[l][r]) return dp[l][r];
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for( int i = l; i<=r; i++){
            ans = min(ans, i + max(solve(l, i-1, dp), solve(i+1, r, dp) ) );
        }
        dp[l][r] = ans;
        return ans;
    }
};
```
