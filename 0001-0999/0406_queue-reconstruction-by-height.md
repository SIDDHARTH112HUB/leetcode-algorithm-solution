[406.queue-reconstruction-by-height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)  

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

**Note:**  
The number of people is less than 1,100.

 

**Example**

  
Input:
  
\[\[7,0\], \[4,4\], \[7,1\], \[5,0\], \[6,1\], \[5,2\]\]
  

  
Output:
  
\[\[5,0\], \[7,0\], \[5,2\], \[6,1\], \[4,4\], \[7,1\]\]  



**Solution:**  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](auto &a, auto &b){
            if(a[0] == b[0]) return a[1] < b[1];
            return a[0] > b[0];
        });
        vector<vector<int> > ans;
        for(auto &p : people) {
            ans.insert(ans.begin() + p[1], p);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
