[879.profitable-schemes](https://leetcode.com/problems/profitable-schemes/)  

There are G people in a gang, and a list of various crimes they could commit.

The `i`\-th crime generates a `profit[i]` and requires `group[i]` gang members to participate.

If a gang member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a _profitable scheme_ any subset of these crimes that generates at least `P` profit, and the total number of gang members participating in that subset of crimes is at most G.

How many schemes can be chosen?  Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

  
**Input:** G = 5, P = 3, group = \[2,2\], profit = \[2,3\]
  
**Output:** 2
  
**Explanation:** 
  
To make a profit of at least 3, the gang could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
  
In total, there are 2 schemes.
  

**Example 2:**

  
**Input:** G = 10, P = 5, group = \[2,3,5\], profit = \[6,7,8\]
  
**Output:** 7
  
**Explanation:** 
  
To make a profit of at least 5, the gang could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
  
There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).
  

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= G <= 100`
2.  `0 <= P <= 100`
3.  `1 <= group[i] <= 100`
4.  `0 <= profit[i] <= 100`
5.  `1 <= group.length = profit.length <= 100`  



**Solution:**  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    
    int profitableSchemes(int G, int P, vector<int>& group, vector<int>& profit) {
        int M = 1000000007;
        long long dp[G+1][P+1] = {0};
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for( int i = 0; i<group.size(); i++){
            int g = group[i];
            int p = profit[i];
            for( int k = G-g; k >=0; k--){
                for( int j = P; j>=0; j--){
                    dp[k+g][j] += dp[k][max(j-p,0)];
                    dp[k+g][j] %= M;
                }
            }
        }
        long long ans = 0;
        for( int i = 1; i<= G; i++){
            ans += dp[i][P];
            ans %= M;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
