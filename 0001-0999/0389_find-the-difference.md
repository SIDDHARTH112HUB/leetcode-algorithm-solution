Given two strings **_s_** and **_t_** which consist of only lowercase letters.

String **_t_** is generated by random shuffling string **_s_** and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in **_t_**.

**Example:**

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.  



**Solution:**  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int cnt[128] = {0};
        for(auto c : s)
            ++cnt[c];
        for(auto c : t)
            if(--cnt[c] < 0)
                return c;
        return 0;
    }
};
```
