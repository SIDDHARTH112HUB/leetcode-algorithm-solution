[1086.high-five](https://leetcode.com/problems/high-five/)  

Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of each student's **top five scores** in **the order of each student's id**.

Each entry `items[i]` has `items[i][0]` the student's id, and `items[i][1]` the student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer division.

**Example 1:**

  
**Input:** \[\[1,91\],\[1,92\],\[2,93\],\[2,97\],\[1,60\],\[2,77\],\[1,65\],\[1,87\],\[1,100\],\[2,100\],\[2,76\]\]
  
**Output:** \[\[1,87\],\[2,88\]\]
  
**Explanation:** 
  
The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
  
The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their average converts to 88.
  

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= items.length <= 1000`
2.  `items[i].length == 2`
3.  The IDs of the students is between `1` to `1000`
4.  The score of the students is between `1` to `100`
5.  For each student, there are at least 5 scores  



**Solution:**  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> highFive(vector<vector<int>>& items) {
        map<int, vector<int> > m;
        for(auto &item: items) {
            m[item[0]].push_back(item[1]);
        }
        vector<vector<int> > ans;
        for(auto it: m){
            sort(it.second.begin(), it.second.end());
            int sum = accumulate(it.second.end()-5, it.second.end(), 0);
            ans.push_back({it.first, sum/5});
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
